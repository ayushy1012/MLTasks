# MLTasks
This Repo consists of 3 ipynb files named MLTASK1,MLTASK2DeepLearning,MLTASK3 which are my attempts for task1 task2 task3 respectively<br>
the png file named "download" is the graph plotted between yactual and ypredicted for 3rd task<br>
For task 2 I took the file "QG_jets.npz" for training as well as testing<br>
USE OF AI :<br>
for task 1 used AI to split the data set into different columns <br>for task 2 used AI to find average value of feature for all electrons in a jet stream (use of masks to ignore null values ) also used AI to learn about learning rate scheduler  <br>for task 3 used AI to plot the plot between predicted and actual value of similarity
